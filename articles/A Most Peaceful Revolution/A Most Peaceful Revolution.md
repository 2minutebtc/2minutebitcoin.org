Make no mistake: Bitcoiners are **revolutionaries**. 

The State always grows. Participating in the democratic process only empowers it as devotees reward it through votes in exchange for entitlements.

Bitcoiners reject this. Understanding that the only winning move in politics is **[to not play](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/an-honest-account-of-fiat-money-2018)** - they abandoned the rules with a totally independent monetary system.

This predictably enraged the State-dependents.
It is no coincidence that Bitcoin’s most hysterical critics overwhelmingly benefit from the State.

All mainstream newspapers have nothing but mockery for an asset that went from 0 to $1 trillion in a decade, with no venture backing, IPO, or founder - just [an open-source body of maintainers](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/saylor-series-the-rise-of-man-through-the-stone-and-iron-ages-episode-1-2020).

# War
We aren’t in a prelude to war - we are **living it**.

War isn’t explicit anymore - people don’t fight on an open battlefield.
War is sanctions, insurgencies, [IED](https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/prep_ied_fact_sheet.pdf)s, drone strikes, infrastructure sabotage a-la NordStream, and **virtual rebellion**.

Bitcoin is at war with the State that tries to control everything. It provides a stable, State-independent system of property rights that outcompetes less stable State-dependent ones.

Bitcoin challenges the State’s most treasured privilege: **the ability to finance itself through inflation and seignorage**, as well as other repressive tools a significant fraction of the world lives under - **capital controls** and **local exchange rate manipulation**.

The world’s couple dozen most authoritarian, inflationary regimes are threatened by its existence. The most vibrant p2p Bitcoin markets are [in such States](https://medium.com/@mattahlborg/nuanced-analysis-of-localbitcoins-data-suggests-bitcoin-is-working-as-satoshi-intended-d8b04d3ac7b2).

# Political Revolution
Bitcoin differs from other cryptocurrencies by its **soul**.

Reinventing a monetary system takes irrational zeal and an unwavering commitment to a firm vision of the future.

No other project is building a system to last **decades** and face the State head on.

Success for other cryptocurrencies is an exit. In stark contrast, for Bitcoiners, success is the day when **no exit** is required.

People confused the blockchain revolution as a technological one - “if we can create the most advanced algorithm for securing a blockchain, we will win”. It was always a political revolution.

Going against the State requires hundreds of millions of diehards that believe in a **stable set of values** - clever cryptographic gimmicks cannot inspire and win devotion.

# Bitcoin Values
**Bitcoinism** is an emergent philosophy, embodying a consistent set of many values:

These are not *features* of Bitcoin - they are Bitcoin.

The values **are** the system - the code simply [**automates** the values](https://2minutebitcoin.org/blog/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract-2018). Bitcoiners are serious about retaining the foundational properties because to alter them is **to kill the system**.

Alternative projects hold their values very weakly - they pride [innovation over consistency](https://time.com/6223034/ethereum-merge-sanctions-flashbots/).

# The Future
You may deride Bitcoin, no matter - it will be there for you when you need it.

You may not need it now, but as we plunge into a more despotic, financially-repressive, authoritarian, and chaotic world, you may one day feel comfort knowing that the world’s [highest assurance](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-2019) wealth protection system in history is waiting patiently for you.
